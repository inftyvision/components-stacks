# Ducks in the Forest: A Natural Study

This report examines the behavior and habitat of forest-dwelling ducks, particularly the Wood Duck (*Aix sponsa*).

## Habitat

Wood Ducks are unique among waterfowl as they prefer forested wetlands. They can be found in:
- Wooded swamps
- Freshwater marshes
- Small lakes surrounded by trees
- Stream corridors

## Nesting Behavior

Unlike most ducks, Wood Ducks nest in tree cavities. Their nesting requirements are quite specific:

- Tree cavity size must be between 4-15 inches wide
- Entrance holes should measure 3-4 inches in diameter
- Nests are typically located 6-30 feet above ground
- Sites are usually within one mile of a water source

## Population Data

Recent surveys have shown interesting population trends:

| Year | Population (thousands) | Growth Rate |
|------|----------------------|-------------|
| 2020 | 3,750 | +2.3% |
| 2021 | 3,850 | +2.7% |
| 2022 | 4,000 | +3.9% |

# Conservation Efforts

Our team has implemented several conservation strategies to protect these beautiful birds.

## Nesting Box Program

The artificial nesting box program has been highly successful:
- Installed 150 nesting boxes across the forest
- 127 boxes were occupied by breeding pairs
- 84.7% occupancy rate in the first season
- Average of 12 eggs per successful nest
- Hatchling survival rate of 92%

## Future Plans

> "The success of our Wood Duck conservation program demonstrates that targeted habitat protection, combined with artificial nesting structures, can make a significant difference in waterfowl populations."

## Additional Observations

Our research team has noted several interesting behaviors:

1. **Feeding Patterns**
   - Most active during dawn and dusk
   - Primarily feed on aquatic plants
   - Also consume acorns and other tree nuts
   - Will occasionally eat insects and small aquatic creatures

2. **Social Behavior**
   - Form strong pair bonds during breeding season
   - Males assist in nest selection
   - Females return to successful nesting sites year after year
   - Young leave nest within 24 hours of hatching

3. **Seasonal Movements**
   - Some populations are year-round residents
   - Others migrate short distances for winter
   - Return to breeding grounds in early spring
   - Show strong site fidelity
